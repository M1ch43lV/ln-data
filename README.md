## LN Data Collection

This repo contains scripts that can be used to collect, export and 
pseudonymize a lightning node's data. 

This is just a collection of scripts for research purposes - not 
intended for use in production.

Scripts available are: 
- [LND forwarding history](forwarding-history/README.md)
- [Circuitbreaker utilization](channel-utilization/README.md)
